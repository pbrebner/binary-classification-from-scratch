# COMP 551 Project 1 - Binary Classification

Data Analysis, Data Cleaning and Classifcation on four popular datasets using Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes

## Task 1 Acquire, Preprocess and Analyze the Data
Acquire the Data from UCI datasets, clean the data, and perform basic statistics to better understand the Data

Datasets used: Adult Census, Breast Cancer Diagnosis, Ionoshere Data, White Wine Quality

## Task 2 Implement the Models
Implement Both Models from Scratch. 

Logistic regression with full batch gradient descent for optimization

Naive Bayes with appropriate type of liklihood for features of the datasets

## Task 3 Run Experiments
Used 5 fold cross validation to estimate accuracy in all of the experiments.

Experiments Included:
1. Compare the accuracy of Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression on the four datasets
2. Test different leanring rates for gradient descent applied to logisitc regression
3. Compare the accuracy of the models as a function of the size of the dataset (controlling the training size)
